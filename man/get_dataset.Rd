\title{Download and Read a Dataset from Kaggle}
\usage{
get_dataset(dataset)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A character string specifying the dataset identifier on Kaggle. It should follow the format "username/dataset-name".}
}
\value{
A list of data frames, where each data frame corresponds to a CSV file extracted from the dataset's ZIP archive.
}
\description{
This function retrieves a dataset from Kaggle by downloading its metadata and associated ZIP file, then reading all CSV files contained in the archive. The ZIP file is downloaded to a temporary location and extracted to another temporary directory. Each CSV file is then imported as a data frame, and the function returns a list of these data frames.
}
\details{
The function constructs the metadata URL based on the provided dataset identifier, then sends a GET request using the \code{httr} package. If the request is successful, the returned JSON metadata is parsed. The function searches the metadata for a file with an encoding format of "application/zip", then downloads that ZIP file using a temporary file (managed by the \code{withr} package). After unzipping the file into a temporary directory, the function locates all CSV files, reads each using \code{readr::read_csv}, and returns a list of data frames. If any of the following occur, the function stops with an error:
\itemize{
  \item The HTTP request fails.
  \item No ZIP file URL is found in the metadata.
  \item No CSV files are found in the unzipped contents.
}
}

\dontrun{
  # Download and read the "canadian-prime-ministers" dataset from Kaggle
  canadian_prime_ministers <- get_dataset("benjaminsmith/canadian-prime-ministers")
  # Access the first data frame from the list
  df <- canadian_prime_ministers[[1]]
}
